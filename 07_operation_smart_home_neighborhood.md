1. **Verify** Raspberry Pi is powered up and running with a browser running Ignition SCADA screen.  This should have been done in the setup. If the Raspberry Pi is not setup see setup section.
2. **Connect** PC (or Smartphone) to the system.  You can use  either of the following methods to connect:
  -  **Ethernet cable** connected to the PC.  This is a simple method if you have access to the ethernet settings set to: Automatic (DHCP) 
  -  **Wifi** can be used on a PC or smartphone.  Connect to the following:
      -  **SSID (service set identifier):** IT4Project
      -  **Password:** IOT12345
3. **Open web browser** on PC or Smartphone us this link or scan the following QR code:

4. You should now have a screen that looks like the following.

5. **Plug-In / Power-up** Arduino Smart Home that your instructor assigned to you. During power-up you should see messages displayed on the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen.  If the smart home successfully connects you should something similar to the following screen:

6. **Select** the neighborhood and Smart Home number associated with the Smart Home you are working with using the dropdowns.
7. **Did it work?** If you see the count increasing on the web browser, congratulations! You have successfully set up the Pi and Arduino Smart Home. If not, you'll need to diagnose what might be going wrong. For assistance in resolving issues, refer to the troubleshooting section.
8. Verify temperature, humidity and count data sent from Smart Home to the Ignition  SCADA screen on the PC or smartphone browser.
9. Press yellow buttons on Smart Home to observe changes on Ignition SCADA.
10. Use Ignition SCADA to control outputs: yellow LED, color LED and buzzer.
11. Now observe other homes in the neighborhood by switching the Smart Home number in the SCADA.  Try controlling the outputs of those homes.
12. To observe data published to cloud press the CLOUD button.  If other neighborhoods are sending data to the cloud you should be able to see those neighborhoods in the dropdown.
13. In the top left corner of the Ignition SCADA screen, you'll find an icon with three bars. Click this icon to open the screen selection menu. Explore the menu to discover additional functions based on your connected devices, such as:
    -  Tutorial: Provides guidance on getting started with the system.
    -  SMART HOME: Allows interaction with Smart Homes on smaller displays.
    -  OBJECT DETECTION: Displays the count of people when a camera is connected to the system.
    -  CONVEYOR: Allows interaction with Smart Conveyors in the system.
    -  BIG SCREEN: Displays a combination of all the screens listed above.
14. When you are done exploring the system, demonstrate functions that you have learned to your instructor.
