4.The Arduino directory contains the required libraries and the arduino code for the home.
https://github.com/CCC-Industry4/IIOT-4.0-Project/tree/main/Arduino
A. Visit the Arduino Tutorial section if the Arduino IDE is not installed and set up.
I. Install driver
II. Add the ESP32 Environment
III. The libraries for this project are using a previous version of ESP32 environment.
IV. Ensure version 1.0.6 is installed. Click Tools > Boards > Boards Manager.
![Arduino IDE Board Manager](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fac6e1c6-107c-4fe6-b8f3-d1a12cbf5253)
V.Select ESP32 Dev Module as the board. Click Tools > Board > esp32 > ESP32 Dev Module. 
B. Include all the libraries in the libs folder to Arduino IDE.
C. Upload the Arduino.ino file to the smart home.
